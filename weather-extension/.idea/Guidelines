Assignment 6: Chrome Extension – Check Weather from Current Location
🎯 Objective:
Create a Chrome Extension that fetches and displays the current weather
based on the user’s real-time location using a public API.

📦 What You Will Build:
A simple extension with a popup interface that:
Requests the user's current location
Sends that location to a public weather API
Displays basic weather details (temperature, city, condition)

📁 Project Structure:
Create a folder named weather-extension with the following files:
weather-extension/
├── manifest.json
├── popup.html
├── popup.js
├── styles.css
└── icons/
    └── icon.png (your own weather icon)

📝 Instructions:
1️⃣ Setup manifest.json (OK)
Use Manifest V3
Define your extension name, version, description
Add permissions:
"geolocation"
"host_permissions" for a weather API domain (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

2️⃣ Create popup.html
Design a popup that includes:
A heading
A button to trigger weather fetching
A section to display weather results

3️⃣ Add Styling (styles.css)
Use CSS to make the popup look clean and centered. Keep it minimal.

4️⃣ Write popup.js
Use the Geolocation API to get user coordinates
Call a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) with fetch()
Display:
City name
Current temperature
Weather condition

5️⃣ Load Your Extension
Go to chrome://extensions
Enable Developer Mode
Click Load Unpacked
Select your weather-extension folder

Test the popup!

💡 Tips:
You’ll need a free API key from a public weather service
Try https://openweathermap.org
Make sure your extension has internet access (set correct permissions)
Show an error message if:
User denies location
The API fails

🧪 Bonus Challenges (Optional):
Show a weather icon based on conditions
Store last result using localStorage
Add a switch to change between °C / °F
Add loading animation while data is being fetched
