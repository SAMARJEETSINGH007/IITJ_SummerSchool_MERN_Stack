<div>: A generic container used to group elements for styling or layout with CSS.
<header>: Represents the top section of the page, usually contains the logo, navigation, etc.
<main>: Denotes the main content of the page (should be unique per page).
<footer>: Defines the bottom section of the page, usually for copyright, links, or contact info.
<aside>: Contains content that is tangentially related (like sidebars or tips).
<article>: Represents self-contained content that can be independently distributed or reused (like a blog post or news article).
<input>: Allows user input into a form (e.g., typing text, selecting checkboxes).
<select>: Creates a drop-down list for selecting one or more options.
<a>: Defines a hyperlink that can link to another page, section, or external site.
<label>: Associates text with a form input element, improving accessibility and usability.

WHY CHOOSE SPECIFIC INPUT TYPES:
<input type="text">: For free-form single-line text input (e.g., name, city).
<input type="radio">: Lets users choose one option from a set (e.g., gender).
<input type="checkbox">: Lets users select multiple options (e.g., interests).
<input type="email">: Ensures the input follows a valid email format (example@domain.com).
<input type="password">: Hides the text as it's typed for secure password entry.
<input type="date">: Lets users pick a date from a calendar UI.
<input type="tel">: Accepts phone numbers, optionally with input formatting on mobile devices.
