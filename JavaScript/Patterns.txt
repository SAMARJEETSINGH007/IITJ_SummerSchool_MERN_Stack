CREATION OF PROMPT.
when you create a prompt, at that time you have to do the following
create the const of the concerned css element on which you would add the eventListener. Also have a log or multiple logs on which u are going to show
your message...you must go like this
const variable_Element=document.querySelector("#elementID");
(say it is like a document ie the prompt and you are showing it to the user that is why u are using the document.)
(query selector is just for identifying the css element)
similarly, you have the log. It is actually  <pre> but you had id as log
const message=document.querySelector("#log");
now on the variable_Element you add the event listener.
so you go like:
variable_Element.addEventListener("click",()=>{});
(add click to say 'what element it is!')
(the arrow function is added as we just need to perform a function on it. need not name it.)
now we can get prompt like
--> this is inside the arrow function.
(()=>{
const popUp=prompt("Your first number here");<--the variable will automatically catch the value.
});
for log you can go like
message.textContent=`number ${anyVariableYouHad}`
and for alert you can go like 
alert(`The sum is ${}`);
PAY ATTENTION THAT IN PROMPT WE GO LIKE const/let/var var_name=prompt(""); 
IN ALERT WE GO LIKE 				      	       alert=("");
IN LOG YOU GO LIKE			var_log.textContent=``;
