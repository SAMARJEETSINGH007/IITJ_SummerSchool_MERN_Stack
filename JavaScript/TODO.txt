Go over the function methods in day 6
Revise this argument over the for each loop
In here I didn't get the idea behind the usage of object declaration in the map() for thisArg. Why do we get the undefined in that case?like why does 
it go from say return num*=this.multiplier to return num*=undefined when we do say 'const arrNumDouble=arr.map(obj.multiplier,obj2);' why obj2?
In filter do flattening array, grouping objects.
